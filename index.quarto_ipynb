Alternatively, delete the Python code and only leave the remaining R code that is provided.  You can see the executed Python output at my GitHub pages site: [https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/](https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/).\n",

        "**Core Question:** How does the number of trees in a random forest affect predictive accuracy, and how do random forests compare to simpler approaches like linear regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Challenge:** Individual decision trees are \"weak learners\" with limited predictive power. Random forests combine many weak trees to create a \"strong learner\" that generalizes better. But how many trees do we need? Do more trees always mean better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns?\n",
