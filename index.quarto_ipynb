Alternatively, delete the Python code and only leave the remaining R code that is provided.

        "**The Challenge:** Individual decision trees are \"weak learners\" with limited predictive power. Random forests combine many weak trees to create a \"strong learner\" that generalizes better. But how many trees do we need? Do more trees always mean better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns?\n",
