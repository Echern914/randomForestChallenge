## 🎯 Note on Python Usage

You have not been coached through setting up a Python environment.  **If using Python** You will need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary packages to run this code - takes about 15 minutes; see [https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html).  Alternatively, delete the Python code and only leave the remaining R code that is provided.  You can see the executed Python output at my GitHub pages site: [https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/](https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/).

## The Problem: Can Many Weak Learners Beat One Strong Learner?

**Core Question:** How does the number of trees in a random forest affect predictive accuracy, and how do random forests compare to simpler approaches like linear regression?

**The Challenge:** Individual decision trees are "weak learners" with limited predictive power. Random forests combine many weak trees to create a "strong learner" that generalizes better. But how many trees do we need? Do more trees always mean better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns?

**Our Approach:** We'll compare random forests with different numbers of trees against linear regression and individual decision trees to understand the trade-offs between complexity and performance **for this dataset**.

## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## Data and Methodology

We analyze the Ames Housing dataset, which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Anticipated Non-linear Relationships:** Real estate prices have complex, non-linear relationships between features (e.g., square footage in wealthy vs. poor zip codes affects price differently)
- **Mixed Data Types:** Contains both categorical (zipCode) and numerical variables
- **Real-world Complexity:** Captures the kind of messy, real-world data where ensemble methods excel

Since we anticipate non-linear relationships, random forests are well-suited to model the relationship between features and sale price.

## Student Analysis Section: The Power of More Trees {#student-analysis-section}

**Your Task:** Create visualizations and analysis to demonstrate the power of ensemble learning. You'll need to create three key components:

### 1. The Power of More Trees Visualization

**Create a visualization showing:**
- RMSE vs Number of Trees (both training and test data)
- R-squared vs Number of Trees
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization

**Add Brief Discussion of the Visualization**
- Discuss where the most dramatic improvement in performance occurs as you add more trees, how dramatic is it?
- Discuss diminishing returns as you add more trees

```{python}
#| label: power-of_trees-visualizationV1
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 5
#| out.width: 90%

# Create the visualization showing the power of more trees
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 5))

# Plot 1: RMSE vs Number of Trees
ax1.plot(performance_df['Trees'], performance_df['RMSE_Train'], 'o-', label='Training RMSE', linewidth=2, markersize=6)
ax1.plot(performance_df['Trees'], performance_df['RMSE_Test'], 's-', label='Test RMSE', linewidth=2, markersize=6)
ax1.set_xlabel('Number of Trees')
ax1.set_ylabel('RMSE')
ax1.set_title('RMSE vs Number of Trees')
ax1.set_xscale('log')
ax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax1.legend()
ax1.set_xlim(0.8, 6000)

# Plot 2: R-squared vs Number of Trees
ax2.plot(performance_df['Trees'], performance_df['R_squared'], 'o-', color='green', linewidth=2, markersize=6)
ax2.set_xlabel('Number of Trees')
ax2.set_ylabel('R-squared')
ax2.set_title('R-squared vs Number of Trees')
ax2.set_xscale('log')
ax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax2.set_xlim(0.8, 6000)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The biggest performance gains occur when moving from 1 to 5 trees, with RMSE dropping significantly and R-squared improving substantially. Beyond 100 trees, improvements become marginal - the curves flatten out showing diminishing returns.

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Visualization Requirements

Create two plots:
1. **RMSE Plot:** Show how RMSE decreases with more trees (both training and test)
2. **R-squared Plot:** Show how R-squared increases with more trees

Use log scale on x-axis to better show the relationship across the range of tree counts.

The biggest performance gains occur when moving from 1 to 5 trees, with RMSE dropping significantly and R-squared improving substantially. Beyond 100 trees, improvements become marginal - the curves flatten out showing diminishing returns.

### 2. Overfitting Visualization and Analysis

**Your Task:** Compare decision trees vs random forests in terms of overfitting.

**Create one visualization with two side-by-side plots showing:**
- Decision trees: How performance changes with tree complexity (max depth)
- Random forests: How performance changes with number of trees

**Your analysis should explain:**
- Why individual decision trees overfit as they become more complex
- Why random forests don't suffer from the same overfitting problem
- The mechanisms that prevent overfitting in random forests (bootstrap sampling, random feature selection, averaging)

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Overfitting Analysis Requirements

Create a side-by-side comparison showing:
1. **Decision Trees:** Training vs Test RMSE as max depth increases (showing overfitting)
2. **Random Forests:** Training vs Test RMSE as number of trees increases (no overfitting)

- Use the same y-axis limits for both side-by-side plots so it clearly shows whether random forests outperform decision trees.
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization
:::

```{python}
#| label: overfitting-comparison
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 5


from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create decision trees with different max depths
max_depths = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20]
dt_train_rmse = []
dt_test_rmse = []

for depth in max_depths:
    dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=depth, random_state=123)
    dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    train_pred = dt.predict(X_train)
    test_pred = dt.predict(X_test)
    
    dt_train_rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, train_pred)))
    dt_test_rmse.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, test_pred)))

# Create side-by-side comparison
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 5))

# Plot 1: Decision Trees - Overfitting
ax1.plot(max_depths, dt_train_rmse, 'o-', label='Training RMSE', linewidth=2, markersize=6)
ax1.plot(max_depths, dt_test_rmse, 's-', label='Test RMSE', linewidth=2, markersize=6)
ax1.set_xlabel('Max Depth')
ax1.set_ylabel('RMSE')
ax1.set_title('Decision Trees: Overfitting with Complexity')
ax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax1.legend()

# Plot 2: Random Forests - No Overfitting
ax2.plot(performance_df['Trees'], performance_df['RMSE_Train'], 'o-', label='Training RMSE', linewidth=2, markersize=6)
ax2.plot(performance_df['Trees'], performance_df['RMSE_Test'], 's-', label='Test RMSE', linewidth=2, markersize=6)
ax2.set_xlabel('Number of Trees')
ax2.set_ylabel('RMSE')
ax2.set_title('Random Forests: No Overfitting with More Trees')
ax2.set_xscale('log')
ax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax2.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Decision trees show clear overfitting - training RMSE drops dramatically while test RMSE increases after depth 4, creating a growing gap. Random forests avoid this problem entirely - both training and test RMSE improve together as more trees are added, with no performance gap emerging.

### 3. Linear Regression vs Random Forest Comparison

**Your Task:** Compare random forests to linear regression baseline.

**Create a comparison table showing:**
- Linear Regression RMSE
- Random Forest (1 tree) RMSE  
- Random Forest (100 trees) RMSE
- Random Forest (1000 trees) RMSE

**Your analysis should address:**
- The improvement in RMSE when going from 1 tree to 100 trees
- Whether switching from linear regression to 100-tree random forest shows similar improvement
- When random forests are worth the added complexity vs linear regression
- The trade-offs between interpretability and performance

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Comparison Requirements

Create a clear table comparing:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest (1 tree)
- Random Forest (100 trees) 
- Random Forest (1000 trees)

Include percentage improvements over linear regression for each random forest model.
:::

```{python}
#| label: linear-regression-comparison
#| echo: false

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Fit linear regression model
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get predictions
lr_train_pred = lr.predict(X_train)
lr_test_pred = lr.predict(X_test)

# Calculate RMSE
lr_train_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, lr_train_pred))
lr_test_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, lr_test_pred))

# Get RMSE values for random forests (from our previous analysis)
rf_1_test_rmse = rmse_1_test
rf_100_test_rmse = rmse_100_test
rf_1000_test_rmse = rmse_1000_test

# Create comparison table
comparison_data = {
    'Model': ['Linear Regression', 'Random Forest (1 tree)', 'Random Forest (100 trees)', 'Random Forest (1000 trees)'],
    'Test RMSE': [lr_test_rmse, rf_1_test_rmse, rf_100_test_rmse, rf_1000_test_rmse],
    'Improvement over Linear Regression': ['-', 
                                         f'{((lr_test_rmse - rf_1_test_rmse) / lr_test_rmse * 100):.1f}%',
                                         f'{((lr_test_rmse - rf_100_test_rmse) / lr_test_rmse * 100):.1f}%',
                                         f'{((lr_test_rmse - rf_1000_test_rmse) / lr_test_rmse * 100):.1f}%']
}

comparison_df = pd.DataFrame(comparison_data)
print(comparison_df.to_string(index=False))
```

The improvement from 1 tree to 100 trees is substantial - similar to switching from linear regression to a 100-tree random forest. Random forests are worth the complexity when you need better performance and can sacrifice interpretability. The trade-off is clear: linear regression is simple and interpretable but limited, while random forests capture complex patterns at the cost of interpretability.
